## Comments
I'm still getting used to creating branches, and while I don't think it affected me much this assignment if it shows in my work please let me know.

I guess I am trying to ask if you are supposed to make a branch before your intended changes, or after those changes are done and you are ready to move on to the next branch. I hope that makes sense, and thanks for your help!

I've attached a screenshot of my terminal during my workflow to show how the master and mobile-first branches are, what seems to me, in the wrong place. Ideally would the master branch be with the initial commit, and "mobile-first" where the master currently sits?
