## Comments
I'm still getting used to creating branches, and while I don't think it affected me much this assignment if it shows in my work please let me know.

I've attached a screenshot of my terminal during my workflow to show how the master and mobile-first branches are, what seems to me, in the wrong place. Ideally would "master" be with the initial commit, and "mobile-first" where the master currently sits? Thanks for your help.
